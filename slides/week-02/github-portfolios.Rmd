# Video walkthroughs

These are from Math-241 Data Science, but the general process is the same.

A. [Linking Github to RStudio](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eqhqfyzm5jlfmyv/github-rstudio-A.mov?dl=0)

Differences:
- I have not created your repo - you will do / have done that.
- You should probably put your first problem set in a folder called `problem-sets`.
- You're welcome to download the template from `course-materials` or modify the default as shown in video.

B. [Committing and Pushing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g9odv0vcvs8ze3g/github-rstudio-B.mov?dl=0)
