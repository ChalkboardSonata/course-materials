# Example: Truck prices

Can we use the age of a truck to predict what its price should be?  Consider a 
random sample of 43 pickup trucks.

--

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
pickups <- read.csv("http://andrewpbray.github.io/data/pickup.csv")
ggplot(pickups, aes(x = year, y = price)) +
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
```

# Example: Truck prices

Can we use the age of a truck to predict what its price should be?  Consider a 
random sample of 43 pickup trucks *from the last 20 years*.

--

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center"}
pickups <- filter(pickups, year >= 1994)
ggplot(pickups, aes(x = year, y = price)) +
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
m1 <- lm(price ~ year, data = filter(pickups, year >= 1994))
```

---
# Linear model?

--

.tiny[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(m1)$coef
```
]

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(pickups, aes(x = year, y = price)) +
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "orchid")
```


---
# Linearity and normality

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center", fig.width=10}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(m1, 1:2)
```

--

The normality assumption on the errors seems fine but there seems to be a quadratic
trend in the mean function.


---
# Constant variance and influence

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center", fig.width=10}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(m1, c(3, 5))
```

--

One observation (44) should be investigated for its influence.  There is
evidence of increasing variance in the residuals.

---
# Transformations

```{r out.width=500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/walter-white.jpg")
```

Say you fit a linear model to data and find the residual plots look awful. One
strategy to regain a valid model is to transform your data.

---

.tiny[
```{r}
pickups <- mutate(pickups, log_price = log(price))
```
]

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
p1 <- ggplot(pickups, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
p2 <- ggplot(pickups, aes(x = log_price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

Variables that span multiple orders of magnitude often benefit from a natural
log transformation.

$$Y_t = log_e(Y)$$

---
# Log-transformed linear model

.tiny[
```{r}
m2 <- lm(log_price ~ year, data = pickups)
summary(m2)$coef
```
]

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center",}
ggplot(pickups, aes(x = year, y = log_price)) +
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "orchid")
```


---
# Linearity and normality

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center", fig.width=10}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(m2, 1:2)
```

--

The residuals from this model appear less normal, though the quadratic trend in
the mean function is now less apparent.

---
# Constant variance and influence

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.align = "center", fig.width=10}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(m2, c(3, 5))
```

There are no points flagged as influential and our variance has been stabilized.

---
# Transformations summary

- If a linear model fit to the raw data leads to questionable residual plots,
consider transformations.

--

- Count data and prices often benefit from transformations.

--

- The natural log and the square root are the most common, but you can use any 
transformation you like.

--

- Transformations may change model interpretations.

--

- Non-constant variance is a serious problem but it can often be solved by transforming the response.

--

- Transformations can also fix non-linearity, as can polynomials.
