Using the `glmnet` package, construct a ridge regression and LASSO model
to predict violent crime in the training data set. A description for how
to use this package can be found in your book on pages 251 - 255.

1.  How many variables were selected by the LASSO?
2.  What are the training MSEs for ridge and LASSO using the optimal
    value of \(\lambda\)?
3.  If the MSEs differed, why do you think one is higher than the other
    in this setting?
