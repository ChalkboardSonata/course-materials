# Project

This is your chance to put all of the modeling techniques that you've been learning into action on a question and data set that is of interest to you. The main deliverable will be a presentation during the final week of class, but there are several other components that prepare the groundwork. They are, with their due dates:

1. Pre-proposal: Sunday 11/3 11:59 pm
2. Group proposal: Thursday 11/7 11:59 pm
3. Technical Report (Exploratory Data Analysis section only) : Wednesday 11/20 before class
4. Technical Report: Monday 12/2 before class
5. Final Presentations: Wednesday 12/4 and Monday 12/9 in class

## Pre-proposal

Please suggest three topics that are of interest to you to study in this project. For each, you should indicate your question, whether it suggests a classification or regression model, whether it is primarily predictive or descriptive, and a sense of what data you would use (along with a link if you have it).

An example:

1. Can we built a model to accurate predict whether a person is a republican or democrat based on their tweets? Classification. Predictive. We will train our model on data gather through the Twitter API from elected officials with known party affiliation.

I encourage you to think broadly about your topic area. This can build off of a neat idea you came across in another class, allow you to delve into the data modeling side of a particular hobby of yours, or a chance to build a tool for something that you're passionate about.

When it comes to "data", you can also think beyond CSVs. Rich data lives online in unstructured data at websites like the New York Times archive, IMDB, Yelp, Twitter, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. The data can also be in the form of images or sound files. You might also want to consider generating your own data using a new tool like: http://nickstrayer.me/shinysense/ .

I will be putting people in groups of three. If you have strong opinions of who you'd like to work with, please include those as well.
